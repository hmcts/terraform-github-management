# terraform-offboarding-alerts

This repository provisions Alert rule and Action groups resources which monitors for "disabled user" log entries in Azure Monitor. 
## Alert rule
Alert monitors hmcts-prod log analytics workspace at regular intervals by running a query against Auditlogs searching for "Disable Account".
## Action Group
Action Group points to Azure Devops using webhook endpoint. This enables us to create a service connection of type 'incoming webhook' in Azure Devops.
